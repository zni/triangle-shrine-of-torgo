Triangle Shrine of Torgo
========================

What is this?
-------------

Javascript/canvas based generative art-ish stuff.


What is inside?
---------------
`bars.html` is kind of like a broken video feed.
* requires TinyColor

`blocks.html` is a tiling block pattern.
* requires TinyColor

`static.html` and `static2.html` are older self-contained noisy things that move.

`tritile.html` produces a static triangular tiling on a good day.

`wander.html` produces a static collection of lines, inspired by [Anders Hoff](http://inconvergent.net/generative/linetrace/)
and [John Franzen](http://www.johnfranzen.com/art/JOHN_FRANZEN_-_EACH_LINE_ONE_BREATH_-_PAPER_EDITION.html).

`weird1.html` does a random walk, ideally making a triangular tiling, but
really just shitting triangles over the top of other triangles in opposite
orientations.



Dependencies?
-------------

Some of these require [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor). Put
`tinycolor.js` in the root of this repo's directory.
