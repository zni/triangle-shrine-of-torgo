Triangle Shrine of Torgo
========================

What is this?
-------------

Javascript/canvas based generative art-ish stuff.


What is inside?
---------------

 `static.html` and `static2.html` are older self-contained things that move.
`canvas` is turning into a static triangle pattern zone.

`tritile.js` produces a static triangular tiling.

`weird1.js` does a random walk leaving triangles in its wake.
